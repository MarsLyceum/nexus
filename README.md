# Nexus

Cross‑platform social networking app for organic, interest‑based communities with groups, text channels, feeds, and events.

## Overview

Nexus takes inspiration from Discord and Reddit the idea is to blend Discord style groups with Reddit style groups to
allow for more dynamic groups than either Discord or Reddit allows on its own. Where you can make your group posts like
on Reddit or Facebook Groups but then jump into a text channel to have a quick chat about something with someone.
